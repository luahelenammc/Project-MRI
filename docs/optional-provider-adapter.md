# Optional provider adapter

`mri/nutrient.py` is retained as a deliberately separated integration seam for a future document-operation provider. It is not required for the scanner, web demo, tests or evaluation.

The adapter:

- is disabled by default;
- contains no credential;
- fails closed without explicit live configuration;
- operates downstream from MRI’s evidence packet;
- cannot choose authority or apply source repairs.

No live provider call, output hash, GPU use or sponsor integration is claimed in the current build. Activating a provider would require human approval of account/terms, a fresh privacy/dependency review and a reproducible operation record.
