# Security policy

## Scope

Project MRI is a local, bounded reference implementation. It is not a hosted service and should not be given private or regulated corpora without an independent deployment review.

## Current protections

- ZIP traversal and symlink rejection;
- bounded file count, member size and expanded corpus size;
- UTF-8/text-only ingestion;
- no execution of ingested files;
- no mutation of the original corpus;
- local-only HTTP binding;
- no credentials in fixtures or repository files.

## Reporting

Please do not publish a suspected vulnerability with private data. Open a GitHub issue with a minimal synthetic reproduction, or contact Lua through the public address listed in the repository profile.

## Non-goals

The current protections do not establish tenant isolation, encryption policy, retention compliance, authorization, sandboxing of a deployment or secure processing of sensitive documents.
